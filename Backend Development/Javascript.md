Basics-
Javascript is a [[multiparadigm programming language]]. In Javascript  all Object-oriented, Functional and procedural programming can be done.
A Program in a running state is called a process(in RAM).A javascript program has a .js extension.

**Keywords-** In a programming language, there are words which are reserved  by the language for its own purpose. We cannot change these and cannot repurpose them for our own use-case.
Examples- let, const, if, return.

In order to store the values from the user [[Variables]] are used.
Varibables are memory bucket that stores a value and have a defined name.
One line of javascript code equals to one instruction given to the computer.
One complete instruction is  called  a **statement**.At the end of one statement an optional but **recommended** semicolon has to be put.

**Special Characters**- Special characters are also known as Escape sequences. They are used to inculcate various  command(usually keystrokes) in the program. The most commonly used in the new line character (\\n).

**Comments**- They are the piece of code for the documentation purposes.The compliere/ interpreter will ignore the comments completely. In javascript comments can be created in two ways-
 1. Single line comment - They start will the // (only in the starting of comment)
 2. Multi line comment - They start and end with /* and * / respectively.

**Operators** - There a a various kinds of operators in javascript to perform various operators. They are explained in detail in the following  link - [[Operators in Javascript]].

[[Conditionals in Javascript]]
[[Loops in Javascript]]

DRY Principle- It stands for Don't Repeat Yourself.It is implemented to reduce redundancy and easy debugging of the code.It could be achieved whith the help of [[Functions in Javascript]]

[[Scopes]]

[[Asynchronous Javascript]]
