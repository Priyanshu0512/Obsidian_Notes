Loops are used to repeat a set of statements again and again till the condition is true.

**1. WhileLoops**
    It is an entry controlled looping statement.
    Syntax - while(condition){
    // set of instruction
    Updating statements 
    }
    Updating statements are used to change the condition of the loops so as to prevent the infinite loop.

**2.For Loops**
    Syntax - for( initialisation; condition; updation){
    // set of instructions 
    }

NOTE- There is no advantage in using one loop over the other.

 **3. Do while Loops** 
     If it necessary to run the body of the loop at least once then do while is used.It is exit controlled looping statement.
    Syntax - do{
    //body of loop 
    }while(condition);
