1. ** If else statement **
   Syntax-
   if(condition){
   // block of code
   }
   else{
   // commands to be executed when condition if false.
   }
   Else statement is an optional block.
   if condition is true if block is executed and else block is completely ignored otherwise if the condition is true then if block is completely ignored and else block is executed.

2. ** If else if statement**
   Syntax- if(condition){
   // block of code
   }
   else if(condition){
   // block of code
   }
   else{
   // commands to be executed when condition if false.
   }

**3.Nested if**
Syntax- if(condition){
if(condition){
//block of code
}
else{
//block of code
}
}
else{
// commands to be executed when condition if
false.
}

**4.Switch Case** ```

```js
    Syntax - switch(value or expression){
     case value1:
        //logic
       break;
     case value2:
        //logic
       break;
     case value3:
        //logic
       break;
     default:
        // logic
    }
```

It is necessary to write break after each case as in the absence of break statement all the lines of code in each case will get executed after the matching case is found.
