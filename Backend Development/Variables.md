In javascript there are 3 ways to define a variable.
  1. using the var keyword.
        Syntax- var < variable name > = < value >;
        Example- var score = 76;
  2. using the let keyword
       Syntax - let < variable name > = < value >;
       Example- let flag = 0;
 3. using const keyword
       Syntax- const< variable name > = < value >;
