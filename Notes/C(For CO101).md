Structure programming - it is an programming paradigm which is aimed at improving the clarity quality and development time of the computer program by makeing use of structured flow control constructs of selection (if else ) and repetition (while , do while), block structures and subroutines.
algorithm is a finite sequence of rigourous instructions which is used to solve a class of specific problems or  a computation.

A good algorithm should be able to generate the coreect output for all set of valid inputs.
It should be able to solve the computational problem efficiently   in least time  space complexity.
It should be in human-readable format so that it could futher be modified by people to obtain a specify set of outputs and solve additonal problems.
A data type in programming signifies what type of value will the variable holds.
getche() - It takes the input from any keyboard and immediately display it to the screen without having to wait  for the enter key
getchar()- takes a single character from the standard input stream present in the stdin library. it returns unsigned character cast to it integer value.
getch()- used to get the a single character from the user and it converts it to its equivalent ascii value.
